        Is Nuclear the Future?
Nuclear. What do you think when you heard the word? Fallout? Chaos? Disaster? Scary? Or unbelievable source of energy? Something that won’t wear out for at least decades. So perhaps I should explain to you a bit about this nuclear thing and what it has to offer.
Sustainable energy development, one of the important keys that we as a human should stick on. For the last decades, we’ve been using the natural gas, mining the coal to fulfill our energy needs. But we all know one day; those natural resources will be out of stock for good.
So, what is another option to fulfill our energy needs and importantly, its clean and sustainable? The answer is simple, its nuclear. Alright, how’s that nuclear is clean sustainable? Let me explain 3 points.
Nuclear energy protects air quality.

    <code>
        1. Nuclear energy protects air quality.
Nuclear is a zero-emission clean energy source. It generates power through fission, which is the process of splitting uranium atoms to produce energy. The heat that released by the fission is used to create steam that spins a turbine to generate electricity without any harmful byproducts emitted by fossil fuel.

For example, Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) said that, the US avoided more than 476 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2019, or in another word its same as removing 100 cars from the road.

    <code>
        2.Nuclear energy’s land footprint is small
Even though producing massive amounts of carbon-free power, nuclear energy produces more electricity on less land than any other clean-air sources.

A typical 1,000-megawatt nuclear facility in the United States needs a little more than 1 square mile to operate. NEI says wind farms require 360 times more land area to produce the same amount of electricity and solar photovoltaic plants require 75 times more space.

To put that in perspective, you would need more than 3 million solar panels to produce the same amount of power as a typical commercial reactor or more than 430 wind turbines (capacity factor not included).
</code><br><br>
<code>
    3.Nuclear Energy produces minimal waste
Nuclear fuel is extremely dense. It’s about 1 million times greater than that of other traditional energy sources and because of this, the amount of used nuclear fuel is not as big as you might think. All of the used nuclear fuel produced by the U.S. nuclear energy industry over the last 60 years could fit on a football field at a depth of less than 10 yards! That waste can also be reprocessed and recycled, although the United States does not currently do this. However, some advanced reactors designs being developed could operate on used fuel. The NICE Future Initiative is a global effort under the Clean Energy Ministerial that makes sure nuclear will be considered in developing the advanced clean energy systems of the future.

    In the meantime, even though we thought we had found the answer actually we still far away to actually make it efficient 100%. But I believe over the time our best engineers and scientist will eventually make it all perfect and we can still continue living on a greener planet.
