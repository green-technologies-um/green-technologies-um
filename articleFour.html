        Green Computing is one of the buzz words that have gained prominence in the world of the information technology (IT). Various researchers prefer the use of ‘Green IT’ to ‘Green Computing’, though with same meaning, in order to connect the green computing to the IT world (Sheikh and Lanjewar, 2010). ‘Green Computing’ is often described as the study and procedure involve in the designing, manufacturing, using, and disposing of information and communication technology (ICT) in such a manner that will reduce its adverse impacts on the environment. The study and practices wholesomely covers the computing lifecycle from birth to death (Soomro and Sarwar, 2012). Besides the impact of the IT dimensions on the environmental sustainability, the concept of Green Computing has been extended to economics of energy efficiency, as well as the total cost of ownership, which includes the cost of recycling and disposal (Green Grid, 2010). Green computing is usually associated with saving energy in data centres, minimizing paper consumption and adopting environmentally friendly technologies such as liquid-crystal-display (LCD monitors) rather than cathode- ray-tube (CRT monitors) (Noordin, 2009).

        Green computing became known in the early years of the last two decades when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) launched Energy Star, which is a cataloging program designed to promote and recognize energy-efficiency in monitors, climate control equipment, and other technologies. Consequently, most consumer electronics adopted the use of ‘sleep mode’ in the use of their appliances (Noordin, 2003). Thereafter, ‘Green Computing’ attracted the interests of the environmentalists and their concerns span the environmental impacts of the use and the components of the computer systems. In essence, green computing is all about the efficient use of computers and computing, however the social responsibility, economic viability and the impact on the environment have been integrated in order to make the concept encompassing. In other words, green computing is aim at making the whole practices relating to computers to be environmental, economical, and society-wise friendly (Lakshmi et al., 2012). As an example, users buying hardware that has been approved by Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT), which means maintenance computer is reduced, the hardware’s life is more lasting and enhances recycling computer is easier once it is no longer needed (Saranya and Ponnusamy, 2013).
