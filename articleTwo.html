       Farming sector is essential to our daily life because no matter what we
      need to feed our population that grows rapidly on Earth. However, farming
      sector produce a lot of waste and pollution that posses a danger to the
      environment such as excessive use of pesticide which contaminates the
      surrounding areas that would disrupt the local ecosystem and extensive use
      of land and water that threatens its surrounding nature and wildlife.
      Considering how important this sector for us we need to find more
      environmentally friendly way to feed our population. Current popular
      method is vertical farming, instead of growing crops horizontally we grow
      it vertically. This will solve land and water usage issues since it will
      take less land to open a farm while allowing the farmer to grow more crops
      and reducing water usage by watering the crops from top to bottom using
      the force of gravity and reusing the water from above. The usage of
      pesticide will also get decreased and easier to control due to smaller
      area to apply it. In short, vertical farming is our best choice to grow
      crops sustainably for us and nature until we find another more
      environmentally friendly way to do so.
